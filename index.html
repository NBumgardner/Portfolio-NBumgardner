      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! I write music compositions and computer programs to serve others in the
        future. I earned my <abbr title="Bachelors of Science">B. S.</abbr>
        in Computer Science at
        <a href="http://www.missouristate.edu/">Missouri State University</a>,
        with minors in Math and Music Composition.

      <h3>Online Games and HCI</h3>
      <p>
        This is my most recent team project. As a team of five programmers
        we created two online games and a website to host them on Microsoft
        Azure. We gathered analytics by measuring how long users kept our website
        tabs open or in focus. We used this HCI data to compare the games'
        engagement levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In development, we used an Agile-Scrum work method and multiple
        technologies to complete the project (Jan. 2016 - May 2016).
        <em><a href="https://github.com/NBumgardner/Floe">Floe</a></em>,
        one of the two games, has its source code on GitHub.

        This project was possible by the efforts of a great team of people.
        It was challenging and completed early.
